# one-class-autoencoder-fraud-detection
A deep learning project focused on detecting credit card fraud using one-class anomaly detection with autoencoders. The model is trained solely on normal transaction data to identify anomalous (fraudulent) patterns, providing a robust solution for highly imbalanced datasets in fraud detection.
